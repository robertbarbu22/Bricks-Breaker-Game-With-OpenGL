# Bricks-Breaker-Game-with-OpenGL

- **The game has a paddle controlled by the mouse that changes size at every breaking of a brick**
- **Some of the bricks spin for a better visual effect**
- **If the ball falls outside the paddle zone, the game ends with a losing screen**
- **If all of the bricks are broken, the game ends with a winning screen**
